   * Remove this <code>Fact</code> from the KB. It should be noted that deleting
   * a <code>Fact</code> from the KB does not mean that the information
   * contained in that Fact will necessarily become unknown to Cyc. For example,
   * there are many cases where a Fact may be asserted but also be easily
   * inferable. In those cases, the Fact will no longer be represented in Cyc
   * as a separate assertion, but Cyc's inference system will continue to behave
   * as if it were present in the KB because it is so easily inferable.
   * <p>
   * There are also cases where <code>Fact</code>s can not be deleted. The most
   * prominent of these cases is when the underlying assertion has been forward
   * derived from some other assertion(s). In such cases, the only way to remove
   * the <code>Fact</code> is to remove enough of the assertions it is derived
   * from to prevent it from being inferred. As a general rule of thumb, if you
   * assert something to the Cyc KB, you will also be able to delete it. And you
   * can also delete the vast majority of assertions that were already present
   * in the KB. Extreme care should be taken when deleting Facts that you didn't
   * create, since the process of deletion destructively modified the KB, and
   * deleting facts that Cyc critically relies on may cause it to behave in
   * erratic ways.
   *
   * @throws DeleteException when the underlying assertion can't be removed from
   * the KB.
   * @todo write tests to make sure DeleteException is correctly thrown.
