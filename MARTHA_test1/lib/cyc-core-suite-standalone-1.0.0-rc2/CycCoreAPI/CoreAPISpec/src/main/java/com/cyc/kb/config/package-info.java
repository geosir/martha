/**
 * This package contains useful configuration utilities of the KB API. 
 * 
 * {@link com.cyc.kb.config.KBAPIConfiguration} provides thread local configuration
 * parameters to set the current cyclist, project, default contexts for assertion
 * and query, and transcription. 
 * 
 * Note: Bookkeeping is enabled by default, but it will not work if current cyclist
 * is not set.
 * 
 * {@link com.cyc.kb.config.DefaultContext} is usually used in get and add/set methods that do not take 
 * a context parameter. The method documentation will specify the behavior in detail.
