/**
 * The primary interfaces of the Cyc Session API.
 * 
 * The Session API defines simple, yet flexible configuration-driven management
 * of Cyc sessions -- such as acquiring server addresses, managing connections, 
 * etc. -- so that library and application developers don't need to write it
 * into their own code. At the same time, the API is extensible enough 
 * developers can reasonably write their own modules to address unique 
 * configuration needs.
 * 
 * End users should only need to directly interact with the classes and 
 * interfaces defined in com.cyc.session. Interfaces and classes in sub-packages 
 * are for implementation providers.
